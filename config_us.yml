T0: 1.0        # Reference temperature (dimensionless). Typically left at 1.0.
p0: 2.0        # Reference pressure level for US; >1 means a more stressed baseline.
V0: 500000.0   # Reference volume / credit scale for US (relative size parameter).
U0: 1.0e7      # Baseline internal energy of the US credit system (model scale).
S0: 1.0e6      # Baseline entropy of allocations in the US (model scale).

external_coupling:
  alpha: 0.2   # Strength of external pressure coupling into US indicators (E_p).
  delta: 0.0   # Strength of external temperature coupling (E_T); 0.0 = disabled.
