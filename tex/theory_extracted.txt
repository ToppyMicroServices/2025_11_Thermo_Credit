                                                  Abstract
          We recast the Quantity Theory of Credit (QTC) in a thermodynamic-style state space to
      separate scale, dispersion, and capacity in modern credit systems. The key step is an entropy-
      like dispersion index that factors money-in-circulation and its allocation, combined with an
      explicit capacity variable for bank balance sheets. This mapping is an analytic isomorphism,
      not a physical identity: it is designed for structured bookkeeping, stress diagnostics, and early-
      warning indicators, not for importing physical laws into economics. Withn this framework
      we define an internal potential U (SM , VC , . . . ), derive a first-law-like decomposition of credit
      creation, introduce a Helmholtz-style free energy FC and an exergy-like measure XC , and
      obtain a Maxwell-like integrability condition that makes the mapping empirically falsifiable.
      The construction is deliberately practice-first: all quantities are intended to be computable
      from public data and to support decision-useful monitoring for investors, risk managers, and
      policymakers.


1     Introduction
Classical money-first views such as the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) explain nominal
dynamics in terms of a money stock, its velocity, and shocks or policy actions [1, 2, 3]. More
recent credit-first views, notably the Quantity Theory of Credit (QTC), emphasize that banks
create deposits when they lend and that the use of credit (real vs. financial, productive vs.
speculative) matters for macro-financial outcomes [4, 5]. In parallel, both information theory and
statistical mechanics have inspired analogies for income and wealth distributions [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
    This note takes a minimal and operational step: we build a thermodynamic-style state
description that (i) separates scale and dispersion of monetary/credit uses, (ii) introduces an
explicit capacity variable for bank balance sheets, and (iii) yields testable constraints and early-
warning gauges. The aim is not to claim that macro data obey physical laws, but to provide
a disciplined bookkeeping analogy useful for supervision, stress testing K18 , and systematic
monitoring.


2     Setup and Definitions
We work over a chosen system (jurisdiction, sector set) and time aggregation (e.g. monthly).
Let Min denote money-in-circulation K10 over this domain, and let {qi } be a stable, MECE
(Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)    K15 partition of its uses (real activity, housing
                                      P
credit, securities margin, etc.), with i qi = 1.

2.1   Monetary dispersion entropy
We define an entropy-like extensive index
                                                                      X

                                                                       i

where k > 0 is a conventional scaling constant. This mirrors ideal mixing entropy ∆Smix ∝ N H(x)
and follows the information-theoretic form of Shannon [9]. SM grows with both scale and

dispersion; concentration (reallocation into fewer uses) reduces H(q) and can reduce SM even at
fixed Min .

2.2   Capacity and conjugate variables
We introduce:

 • VC : an effective credit capacity or headroom K4 (e.g. CET1/RWA K3 slack, HQLA (High
   Quality Liquid Assets) K6 -based lending space, liquidity buffers K7 ).

 • TL : a liquidity-intensity index (a “temperature-like” proxy from spreads, turnover, depth).

 • pC : a “credit pressure K5 ” (shadow price of capacity).

    We postulate an analytic potential

                                        U = U (SM , VC , . . .),                                       (2)

and define conjugate quantities
                                                                          

Here U is not a physical internal energy; it is a bookkeeping potential chosen so that a first-law-
like decomposition holds. Classical QTM/QTC do not name U ; we introduce it as an analytic
device.


3     Thermodynamic Correspondence (QTM vs. QTC)
Table 1 summarizes the analogy. Thermodynamic quantities are literal on the left column;
QTM/QTC entries are analogy-level constructs. Heat- and work-like pieces are defined for
bookkeeping only.
   The construction is chosen so that: (i) SM is extensive and sensitive to dispersion; (ii)
VC carries explicit capacity/headroom information; (iii) QTC—unlike classic QTM—naturally
admits a pressure-like channel pC .




                                                     3
4    Bank Credit Creation and the Energy-Like Balance
When a bank grants a new loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit. On the joint
bank–customer system, this is a pure accounting operation (loans create deposits). Within our
mapping, the associated change in the potential U is decomposed as

                         ∆U ≈ T̄L ∆SM − p̄C ∆VC + Wpolicy + ε,                                 (4)

where:

 • ∆SM : change in dispersion entropy from scale and allocation shifts (typically ∆SM > 0 in
   net expansion);

 • ∆VC : change in effective capacity (∆VC < 0 when headroom is used up; then −p̄C ∆VC > 0);

 • Wpolicy : structured policy work K14 from regulation, guarantees, central bank operations, and
   other deliberate interventions;

 • ε: residual term capturing model error and omitted channels.

   Credit creation phases (new lending > repayments) and contraction phases (repayments >
new lending) then exhibit characteristic sign patterns for (∆Min , ∆SM , ∆VC , −p̄C ∆VC ), which
can be tabulated and compared with data. The value of (4) is diagnostic: it forces us to attribute
changes either to dispersion, capacity use, or policy work K14 , rather than conflating them.


5    Free Energy, Exergy, and Early-Warning Gauges
We seek a scalar gauge that (i) decreases as dispersion rises under a fixed environment, and (ii)
upper-bounds structured work extractable over a cycle. A Helmholtz-style free energy provides
this.
    For a fixed reference environment (T0 ), define

                                        FC ≡ U − T0 SM .                                       (5)

Then, under suitable regularity conditions,

                                  dFC = − pC dVC + δWother ,                                   (6)

so that FC plays the role of an available-potential measure. As ∆FC → 0 under chosen boundaries,
policy headroom for structured adjustments is effectively exhausted.
    When an ambient pressure-like parameter p0 is also relevant, an exergy-like functional is

                       XC = (U − U0 ) + p0 (VC − VC0 ) − T0 (SM − SM 0 ),                      (7)

which reduces to −∆FC if VC is fixed and p0 effects are negligible. Because XC depends on
boundary choices (T0 , p0 ), we treat it as an optional, environment-dependent gauge.
   A Gibbs-style free energy
                                      GC ≡ U + p0 VC − T0 SM                           (8)
can be used when (T0 , p0 ) are the natural controls. In applications, we typically monitor FC
(fixed environment) and compare with XC or GC when capacity constraints are explicit (cf.
exergy notions in [11]).

 6    Maxwell-Like Relation and Falsifiability
 Since U is assumed to be a bona fide state potential, mixed partial derivatives commute. Using
 the definitions of TL and pC , we obtain a Maxwell-like condition:
                                                       
                                      ∂TL            ∂pC
                                              =−               .                             (9)
                                      ∂VC SM         ∂SM VC

 Empirically, one can estimate TL (SM , VC ) and pC (SM , VC ) from proxies and test whether (9)
 approximately holds. Systematic violations indicate that the chosen variables are not state-like
 or that proxies and specifications are inadequate. In this sense, the analogy is falsifiable: it is
 not mere rhetoric.


 7    Insights and Practical Tests
 The mapping yields several operational diagnostics:

 (i) Integrability test. Estimate TL and pC as functions of (SM , VC ) and test (9). Failure
     suggests mis-specification of capacity or dispersion metrics.

(ii) Work vs. dispersion decomposition. Use (4) to decompose changes in U into heat-like
     dispersion (T̄L ∆SM ), capacity use (−p̄C ∆VC ), and policy work (Wpolicy ).

(iii) Free-energy and exergy ceilings. Monitor FC or XC as early-warning gauges: sustained
      proximity to zero under stress scenarios flags limited room for non-disruptive adjustment.

(iv) Loop area and hysteresis K17 . Compute loop areas in (SM , VC ) over policy cycles. Non-
     zero areas capture dissipative stress and irreversibility in credit allocation dynamics.

    All of these rely on observable or reconstructible quantities from public balance-sheet and
 market data. Implementation details (exact proxy choices, normalization, robustness checks) are
 part of ongoing empirical work and should be reported alongside results.


 8    Limitations and Scope
 This construction is intentionally modest. Key limitations include:

  • Category dependence. SM depends on the chosen partition of uses. Robustness across
    reasonable partitions must be checked.

  • Proxy noise. TL , VC , pC are built from noisy proxies. Measurement error can break (9) and
    distort the decomposition (4).

  • Quasi-static approximation. Fast crises and regime shifts violate smooth state-variable
    assumptions; the mapping is best seen as quasi-static or coarse-grained.

  • Non-physical. We do not assume microscopic “money particles” or claim that macro-
    financial data obey physical first/second laws. The mapping is analogy-level and judged only
    by empirical usefulness.

  • Identification challenges. Policy, expectations, and shocks act jointly. Causal claims
    require careful research design beyond the bookkeeping framework presented here.

  • Scaling conventions. Constants such as k are conventional. Report normalized metrics
    and sensitivity checks.

This note is designed to accompany code and data (e.g. monthly reports computed from public
sources). A typical implementation:
 • computes SM from Min and a stable MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) K15
   partition of flows;
 • constructs VC from capital ratios, liquidity metrics, and headroom;
 • builds TL from market microstructure indicators;
 • estimates pC via regressions or event-study style differentials;
 • evaluates the decompositions and tests described above.

    This glossary explains the main banking, credit, and regulatory terms used in this note for
readers with a physics background. Definitions are informal and intuition-friendly. When helpful,
we include analogies to thermodynamics or dynamical systems. These are aids to intuition, not
strict identities.

1. Regulation and Bank Balance Sheets
 K1 CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1) 1 Core equity capital of a bank (common shares,
 retained earnings). It absorbs losses and underpins solvency. Analogy: the bank’s fundamental
“energy reserve”.

K2 RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) Total assets weighted by regulatory risk factors. Riskier
exposures receive higher weights. The ratio CET1/RWA is a key prudential metric. Analogy: an
effective load or mass adjusted for fragility.

K3 CET1/RWA ratio and slack CET1/RWA indicates how much high-quality capital
backs risk-weighted assets. Regulation sets a minimum. The slack is the excess above this
minimum and represents capacity to expand or absorb shocks. Analogy: safety margin or unused
headroom in a constrained system.

                                                         6
K4 Credit capacity / Headroom (VC ) Effective room for additional lending, given capital,
liquidity, and internal limits. In this note VC is the state-like variable capturing this remaining
capacity. Analogy: effective volume available before hitting hard walls.

K5 Credit pressure (pC ) Shadow price of capacity: the marginal cost or value of relaxing or
tightening VC . Defined in analogy to pC = −(∂U/∂VC )SM or −∂F/∂VC . Analogy: thermodynamic
pressure; tighter constraints ⇒ higher pC .

K6 HQLA (High Quality Liquid Assets) Very liquid, low-risk assets (e.g. government
bonds) that can be sold quickly in stress. They support liquidity ratios and crisis resilience.
Analogy: high-grade stored energy that can be tapped on demand.

K7 Liquidity buffer Cash plus HQLA held as an emergency reserve to withstand sudden
outflows or market stress. Analogy: a backup battery or safety reservoir.

K8 LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) Regulatory ratio: HQLA divided by projected net
cash outflows over a 30-day stress scenario. It tests short-term liquidity robustness. Analogy:
can the system run for 30 days under worst-case load?

K9 NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) Regulatory ratio over a one-year horizon: stable
funding relative to required stable funding. It limits excessive maturity mismatch. Analogy:
ensuring long-lived assets are backed by sufficiently slow-decaying sources.

2. Money, Credit, and Flow Concepts
K10 Money-in-circulation An operational measure of money that is actually circulating in
the selected system and horizon (e.g. deposits used in payments), not merely base money on the
central bank balance sheet. Analogy: active particles taking part in interactions.

K11 Credit stocks and flows Stocks: outstanding amounts of loans or credit at a given
time. Flows: changes per period (new lending, repayments, net issuance). Analogy: internal
energy vs. power / energy flux.

K12 Margin credit / Securities financing Credit used to finance positions in securities
(e.g. margin loans, certain repos). It amplifies leverage in financial markets and is often separated
from credit to the real economy.

K13 Commercial Paper (CP) Short-term unsecured debt issued by firms. Provides funding
outside traditional bank loans. Analogy: an alternative branch in the credit circuit.

K14 Policy work (Wpolicy ) Deliberate interventions by central banks, regulators, or gov-
ernments: interest rate changes, asset purchases, guarantees, capital rule adjustments, and
similar actions. In our decomposition this is the structured, intentional part of “work”. Analogy:
externally applied work on the system.

3. Structural and Analytical Concepts
K15 MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) A rule for defining
categories: (i) no overlaps between categories, (ii) no gaps in coverage. For the entropy
SM = kMin H(q), the allocation shares qi should be MECE, otherwise SM is distorted by
double counting or omissions.


                                                  7
K16 State variable and proxy A state variable is determined by the current state, not by
the detailed path. In practice, finance uses observable proxies (e.g. ratios, indices) to approximate
such variables. Our Maxwell-like relation tests whether chosen proxies behave as if they came
from a consistent potential U (SM , VC , . . . ).

K17 Hysteresis and loop area If trajectories in the (SM , VC ) plane form loops with non-zero
area over policy or credit cycles, this indicates irreversibility or dissipation-like effects (e.g. stress,
misallocation, or path dependence). Analogy: magnetic hysteresis, frictional cycles, or inelastic
processes.

K18 Stress testing and early-warning indicators Stress tests simulate severe but plausible
scenarios to see whether banks or systems survive. Early-warning indicators attempt to flag
fragility in advance. Within this framework, quantities like FC , XC , and loop areas are intended
as structured candidates to complement such tools.

K19 Money vs. credit (QTM vs. QTC perspective) In traditional Quantity Theory of
Money (QTM), money is primary and credit is often treated as derived. In the Quantity Theory
of Credit (QTC) and in this note, credit creation is primary: bank lending creates deposits, and
money is an accounting outcome of credit decisions. This shift motivates tracking credit capacity
and dispersion as state-like objects.
